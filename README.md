# Capstone Battle of Neighborhoods / Introduction-Business-problem

A Greek company is interested in investing in a Greek restaurant somewhere in London.
They do not care about where in London exactly. They care only in having good returns from their investment. In order to do that, they ask from us to find the best place in London in order to build the proposed type of restaurant. 

Our purpose is to find the optimal place in London to build a Greek restaurant. 

London is a big city with increasingly food industry revenues and we have to persuade them that our proposal worth the trouble. 

In order to fulfill our task we are going to use London Postcodes, divided in 8 area categories:

South East, South West, West, North, East Central, East, West Central, North West.

We are going to choose the area of our restaurant based on the smallest number of food/restaurant venues. 

After we choose the London Area, we are going to explore the neighborhoods in order to have a view of the venue categories and determine the group of neighborhoods we should build the restaurant.

We are going to choose the neighborhood(of the chosen group) that is closest to Central London, in order to take advantage of easy access to a larger number of London citizens.
